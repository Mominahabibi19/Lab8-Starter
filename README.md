Service workers play a crucial role in achieving graceful degradation by allowing web applications to cache essential assets and functionalities, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data.This enables them to function offline or in poor network conditions. By implementing service workers, developers can ensure that even if a user loses network connectivity, they can still access core features of the web application, providing a seamless and uninterrupted experience. Thus, service workers complement the principle of graceful degradation by enhancing the resilience of web applications in adverse conditions.
